the voyage of the beagle
charles darwin

preface

i have stated in the preface to the first edition of this work and in
the zoology of the voyage of the beagle that it was in consequence of
a wish expressed by captain fitz roy of having some scientific person
on board accompanied by an offer from him of giving up part of his own
accommodations that i volunteered my services which received through
the kindness of the hydrographer captain beaufort the sanction of the
lords of the admiralty as i feel that the opportunities which i
enjoyed of studying the natural history of the different countries we
visited have been wholly due to captain fitz roy i hope i may here be
permitted to repeat my expression of gratitude to him and to add that 
during the five years we were together i received from him the most
cordial friendship and steady assistance both to captain fitz roy and
to all the officers of the beagle i shall ever feel most thankful
for the undeviating kindness with which i was treated during our long
voyage 

this volume contains in the form of a journal a history of our
voyage and a sketch of those observations in natural history and
geology which i think will possess some interest for the general
reader i have in this edition largely condensed and corrected some
parts and have added a little to others in order to render the volume
more fitted for popular reading but i trust that naturalists will
remember that they must refer for details to the larger publications
which comprise the scientific results of the expedition the zoology
of the voyage of the beagle includes an account of the fossil mammalia 
by professor owen of the living mammalia by mr waterhouse of the
birds by mr gould of the fish by the rev l jenyns and of the
reptiles by mr bell i have appended to the descriptions of each
species an account of its habits and range these works which i owe
to the high talents and disinterested zeal of the above distinguished
authors could not have been undertaken had it not been for the
liberality of the lords commissioners of her majesty s treasury who 
through the representation of the right honourable the chancellor of
the exchequer have been pleased to grant a sum of one thousand pounds
towards defraying part of the expenses of publication 

i have myself published separate volumes on the structure and
distribution of coral reefs on the volcanic islands visited during
the voyage of the beagle and on the geology of south america the
sixth volume of the geological transactions contains two papers of
mine on the erratic boulders and volcanic phenomena of south america 
messrs waterhouse walker newman and white have published several
able papers on the insects which were collected and i trust that many
others will hereafter follow the plants from the southern parts of
america will be given by dr j hooker in his great work on the botany
of the southern hemisphere the flora of the galapagos archipelago is
the subject of a separate memoir by him in the linnean transactions 
the reverend professor henslow has published a list of the plants
collected by me at the keeling islands and the reverend j m berkeley
has described my cryptogamic plants 

i shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the great assistance which i
have received from several other naturalists in the course of this and
my other works but i must be here allowed to return my most sincere
thanks to the reverend professor henslow who when i was an
undergraduate at cambridge was one chief means of giving me a taste
for natural history who during my absence took charge of the
collections i sent home and by his correspondence directed my
endeavours and who since my return has constantly rendered me every
assistance which the kindest friend could offer 

down bromley kent june 

 i must take this opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to mr 
bynoe the surgeon of the beagle for his very kind attention to me
when i was ill at valparaiso

the object of the expedition was to complete the survey of patagonia

survey the shores of chile peru and of some islands in the
pacific and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the
world on the th of january we reached teneriffe but were prevented
landing by fears of our bringing the cholera the next morning we saw
the sun rise behind the rugged outline of the grand canary island and
suddenly illuminate the peak of teneriffe whilst the lower parts were
veiled in fleecy clouds this was the first of many delightful days
